## ðŸš€ About Me

I am Lavish Goyal, recently graduated from NIT Jalandhar, developing web applications since 2020 and have > 20 months of experience building production grade software with fast-paced startups and off-shore clients.

I am looking out for next opportunity as a full time software developer.

Here are brief accomplishments at my ex organisations:

1. Developed a product from scratch, 0-100, achieving more than 50k visits per week, on peak days reaching a 25k requests per minute. I developed a real-time analytics dashboard and loyalty program for the product as well which has been working in sync perfectly. [here](https://bookings.atccouriers.com.au/v2/quotation/step-1)

2. Proposed, pitched, designed the architecture and developed the integration which led to a 25 lakh/month new revenue stream at my intern organisation.

3. Worked on a system design problem in the codebase where our servers were getting bottlenecked and ensured it to deliver out > 27 million email & SMS communication over a single weekend
